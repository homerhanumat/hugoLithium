# SublimeR-Hugo Demo site

A demonstration of my modification of the [**Sublime Hugo Theme**](https://github.com/dt801ts/sublime-hugo-theme), for use with the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package for R.

Features added so far:

* Tags and Categories
* "Aggregator" taxonomy (send selected posts to, e.g., R-bloggers)
* Option for MathJax
* Additional social media links
* Sharing option for posts
* Option to show post summaries

The theme itself is at:

>[https://github.com/homerhanumat/sublimer-hugo](https://github.com/homerhanumat/sublimer-hugo)

To use the theme with **blogdown**:

```
blogdown::new_site(theme = "homerhanumat/sublimer-hugo")
```
